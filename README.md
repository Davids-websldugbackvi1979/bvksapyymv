Just walked out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Raid 2 and my brain feels like a pack of fire𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬ers went off in a tin can. Where do I even start? Okay, first off, who needs therapy when you have THAT level of chaos blasting in your face for two and a half hours? Seriously, I think I need a nap, or maybe a drink... or just a quiet room with some soft jazz and dim lighting. But here I am, trying to write about it instead. Go figure.

So, we're following this guy Rama again, right? I guess I should've re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 the first movie before jumping into this – my bad. Anyway, Rama's still caught up in the whole mafia mess, and it's like they just threw everything at him, including the kitchen sink, and maybe the entire IKEA catalog. The choreography is insane, though! It's like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a bunch of caffeinated squirrels knife-fighting in a phone booth. Not sure what that actually looks like, but now I kinda want to see it. 

> I mean, the fights felt like a dance, a bloody, bone-crunching dance. But then again, who doesn't want to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 people get brutally artistic with hammers and baseball bats? Oh, and let's not forget the mud pit. Honestly, it was just... so much mud. Seriously, after that scene, I felt like I needed a shower. 

Random thought, the sound of broken glass is officially the soundtrack of my nightmares. Every time someone threw another person through a window, I could feel my last criteria for realism shattering with it. But hey, isn't that what movies are for? To remind us that, compared to imaginary life, our real-life chaos is actually pretty cozy? Or maybe I've just hit caffeine overload. 

Also, I know the movie's supposed to be this raw poetic justice kind of thing, but sometimes it felt like they were throwing violence at the screen just to see if it sticks. Somewhere in all that mess of punches and plots, there's a story, or maybe I'm just too tired to see it. But hey, that's what second viewings are for, right? 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the movie or whatever, relive the madness. 

```python
def survival_rate(beatings, gunfights):
    return 1 if gunfights < 3 else 0
```

And just when I thought I had a grip on the story, BAM, in comes an assassin with dual claw hammers. Because, you know, swords and guns are too main𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮. Thank you, Raid 2, for redefining creative weaponry – I guess that’s one thing off my bucket list. Overall, it’s a wild ride. It's loud, exhausting, pretty sure my pulse hasn't dropped below 120 yet. Now excuse me while I contemplate life's simpler joys, like not running into criminals who play baseball indoors.
